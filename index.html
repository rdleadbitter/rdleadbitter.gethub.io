      <h2>Problem statement: Overcrowding on Campus</h2>
      <p>
        Many student facilities at USC are becoming overcrowded. This leads to inconsistent food wait times and an
        inability to complete activities like physical activity and getting academic help.

        <h2>Affinity diagram: Overcrowding on Campus</h2>
      </a>
      <p>
        We came up with ideas in the categories: user security, functionality, design, advertisement,
        accuracy, information input. Our ideas are mostly related to the app's front end design and
        capabilities. We also considered how the app stores and shares the users' data.

        A student goes to Russell House hoping to get lunch between classes, only to find it is far more crowded 
        than the GrubHub app indicated and their order will take too long. This reminds the student to use their 
        campus crowding tracker app, which shows a high level of crowdedness.
